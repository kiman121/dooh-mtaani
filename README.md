## Description

Kenyan communities often form investment groups known as chamas where members pull resources for a common goal such as investment, saving or supporting a member’s welfare.

It is estimated that chamas manage around Ksh 300 billion in assets. However, chamas fail after a short period of time because of mismanagement of funds, embezzlement and lack of systems to keep track of members’ contributions.

That's where Dooh-Mtaani comes in by providing a platform that will increase accountability to members through member contribution tracking, funds management accounting and reporting. At Dooh-mtaani, we believe that easy access to a chama’s financial information by members will boost participation and foster an environment of transparency mostly on matters funds management.
